# USAID_Contraception_Competition
Eddie's personal version of his workplace's submission to the USAID intel forecast competition

The project aimed to forecast contraception demand in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. My team used a "bread and butter" ARIMA time series model on a per prediction site basis.

The final model is in notebooks/final_arima_naive_model.py
